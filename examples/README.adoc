This directory contains example configurations and usage patterns for the meso-forge-tools ecosystem.

== Overview

The examples demonstrate how to:

* Consume packages from local MinIO channels
* Set up package development environments
* Configure different deployment scenarios
* Integrate with CI/CD workflows

== Available Examples

=== link:consumer-project/[Consumer Project]

A simple example showing how to consume `meso-forge` and `minio-s3-tools` packages in a pixi project.

**Key Features:**
* Multi-channel configuration (local + public)
* Basic task definitions
* Package verification commands

**Files:**
* `pixi.toml` - Project configuration with channel setup

=== link:package-dev-project/[Package Development Project]

A comprehensive example for developers who want to create and maintain conda packages using the meso-forge tooling.

**Key Features:**
* Complete development workflow
* Multi-language package support
* Build and publish automation
* Version management integration

**Files:**
* `pixi.toml` - Full development environment configuration

== Documentation

=== link:local-channel-setup.adoc[Local Channel Setup Guide]

Comprehensive guide covering:

* Channel configuration methods
* Authentication setup
* Troubleshooting common issues
* Best practices and workflows
* CI/CD integration examples

== Quick Start

=== Testing Consumer Project

[source,bash]
----
cd consumer-project
pixi install
pixi run test-install
pixi run test-minio
----

=== Testing Package Development

[source,bash]
----
cd package-dev-project
pixi install
pixi run show-help
pixi run setup-project
----

== Channel Configuration Summary

All examples use a multi-tier channel strategy:

1. **Local Development**: `http://localhost:19000/pixi-local/meso-forge`
2. **Public Release**: `https://prefix.dev/meso-forge`
3. **Standard Packages**: `conda-forge`

This allows seamless development with local packages while falling back to public channels when needed.

== Prerequisites

Before using these examples, ensure you have:

* **pixi** installed and configured
* **MinIO server** running locally (if using local channels)
* **meso-forge** packages built and published

== Support

For issues or questions:

* Check the link:local-channel-setup.adoc[Local Channel Setup Guide]
* Review the main link:../README.adoc[meso-forge-tools README]
* Examine the package recipes in link:../pkgs/[../pkgs/]

== Contributing
